## üéØ Recommended Limits

Based on balanced hybrid configuration (200 chapters/month):

| Limit Type | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Soft Limit** | $50/month | Alert when approaching budget |
| **Hard Limit** | $100/month | Stop API calls if exceeded |
| **Initial Testing** | $10/month | First week of testing |

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to OpenAI Billing Limits

**URL**: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/limits

Or navigate:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com
2. Click your profile (top-right)

### Step 3: Set Hard Limit

1. Find "Hard usage limit" section
2. Click "Set hard limit"
3. Enter: **$100** (or $20 for testing)
4. **Important**: Check "Disable API access when limit reached"
5. Click "Save"

**What happens**: API stops working at $100 to prevent overspending

### Step 4: Enable Notifications

1. Go to "Notification settings"

## üí∞ Cost Expectations

### With Balanced Hybrid Config:

**Per Day** (200 chapters/month = ~7 chapters/day):
- Metadata extraction: 14 queries x $0.015 = $0.21
- Fact-checking: 35 queries x $0.015 = $0.525
- Embeddings: 35 queries x $0.000002 = $0.00007
- **Daily total**: ~$0.74

**Per Week**: ~$5
**Per Month**: ~$22
**Per Year**: ~$264

**Well under $50/month soft limit!**

### If Using Full GPT-4o (not hybrid):

**Per Day**: ~$12
**Per Month**: ~$360
**Would exceed soft limit** ‚Üí Need to increase or optimize

## üîî Alert Recommendations

### Email Alerts Setup:

1. **Daily digest**: Review usage patterns
2. **80% warning**: Check if usage is normal
3. **100% hard limit**: Investigate immediately

### What to do when alerted:

**If usage is higher than expected**:
1. Check analytics: `backend/utils/ai_logging.py`
2. Review CostTracker summary
3. Identify high-cost operations
4. Optimize or increase limit

**If limit is too low**:
1. Verify costs are legitimate
2. Increase soft limit (e.g., $75)
3. Keep hard limit as safety net

## üß™ Testing Period Recommendations

### Week 1: Conservative Testing

**Limits**:
- Soft: $10
- Hard: $20

**Why**: Test with low limits to ensure config is correct

**Expected**: ~$5 for week 1

### Week 2-4: Normal Operation

**Limits**:
- Soft: $50
- Hard: $100

**Why**: Comfortable buffer for 200 chapters/month

**Expected**: ~$22/month

### After Month 1: Optimize

**Review**:
- Actual costs vs. expected
- Usage patterns
- Quality metrics

**Adjust**:
- Limits based on actual usage
- Provider allocation if needed
- Increase limits for scale

## üìä Cost Monitoring

### Daily Check (1 minute):

```bash
cd "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge"

# View cost summary
python3 -c "
from backend.utils.ai_logging import CostTracker
print(CostTracker.get_cost_summary())
"
```

### Weekly Review (5 minutes):

1. Check OpenAI usage: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage
2. Compare with budget
3. Review cost tracking logs
4. Verify spend is on-track

### Monthly Analysis (15 minutes):

1. Full cost breakdown by task
2. Quality vs. cost analysis
3. Optimization opportunities
4. Plan adjustments if needed

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Procedures

### If Hard Limit Reached:

**Symptoms**: API calls return error, system falls back to Gemini/Claude

**Actions**:
1. Check if legitimate usage (analytics dashboard)
2. If legitimate: Increase hard limit temporarily
3. If unexpected: Investigate for bugs/loops
4. Review and optimize

### If Costs Are Too High:

**Options**:
1. **Increase Gemini usage**: Move more tasks to Gemini
2. **Reduce GPT-4o usage**: Only for critical tasks
3. **Optimize prompts**: Shorter prompts = lower costs
4. **Batch operations**: More efficient processing

### If Quality Suffers:

**Options**:
1. **Move back to Claude**: For specific tasks
2. **Hybrid approach**: Critical tasks = GPT-4o/Claude
3. **Increase budget**: Accept higher costs for quality
