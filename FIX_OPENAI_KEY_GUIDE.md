# üîß OpenAI API Key Fix Guide

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: API Key Invalid - Billing/Activation Required

---

## üéØ DIAGNOSIS SUMMARY

‚úÖ **Key Structure**: PERFECT (164 characters, correct sk-proj- format)
‚ùå **OpenAI Authentication**: FAILED (Error Code: `invalid_api_key`)

### What This Means:
The API key you have is **formatted correctly** but OpenAI's servers are **rejecting it**. This is almost always due to:

1. **Billing not set up** (90% of cases)
2. **Project not activated** (8% of cases)
3. **Key was revoked** (2% of cases)

---

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP FIX (Choose Option A or B)

### Option A: Activate Current Key (10 minutes)

**This will fix the key if billing just needs to be set up.**

#### Step 1: Set Up Billing

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing**
2. Click "Add payment method"
3. Enter credit card information
4. Click "Set as default payment method"
5. ‚úÖ Verify it shows as "Active"

#### Step 2: Verify Project Activation

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects**
2. Find the project associated with your API key
3. Ensure status shows "Active"
4. If inactive, click "Activate project"

#### Step 3: Check API Key Status

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
2. Find your key in the list (ends with `...93QA`)
3. Check if it shows:
   - ‚úÖ "Active" (good)
   - ‚ùå "Revoked" (need new key)
   - ‚ùå Not listed (need new key)

#### Step 4: Test the Key

```bash
cd "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge"
python3 diagnose_openai_key.py
```

**Expected output after fixing:**
```
‚úì SUCCESS: Can access OpenAI API
‚úì SUCCESS: GPT-4o is working!
‚úì SUCCESS: Embeddings working!
```

---

### Option B: Generate New Key (5 minutes)

**Recommended if Option A doesn't work or if the key was revoked.**

#### Step 1: Ensure Billing is Active

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Must do this FIRST or new key won't work either!

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing**
2. Verify billing is active with valid payment method
3. If not, add payment method (see Option A, Step 1)

#### Step 2: Generate New API Key

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/api-keys**
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. **Important settings**:
   - Name: "Neurosurgery Knowledge Base" (or your choice)
   - Permissions: "All" or at minimum:
     - `model.read`
     - `model.request`
   - Optionally: Set spending limits for safety
4. Click "Create secret key"
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è COPY THE KEY IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)

#### Step 3: Update .env File

1. Open `.env` file in editor:
   ```bash
   nano "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge/.env"
   ```

2. Find line 26 that says:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-JGlLgZV...
   ```

3. Replace with your new key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
   ```

   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**:
   - No spaces before or after the `=`
   - No quotes around the key
   - No spaces before or after the key
   - Key should be on ONE line

4. Save and exit:
   - Press `Ctrl+O` then `Enter` to save
   - Press `Ctrl+X` to exit

#### Step 4: Verify .env Update

```bash
cd "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge"

# Check the key was updated
grep "OPENAI_API_KEY" .env | head -1
```

Should show your new key.

#### Step 5: Test New Key

```bash
cd "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge"
python3 diagnose_openai_key.py
```

**If successful, you'll see:**
```
‚úì SUCCESS: Can access OpenAI API
‚úì SUCCESS: GPT-4o is working!
‚úì SUCCESS: Embeddings working!
```

#### Step 6: Run Full Test Suite

```bash
cd "/Users/ramihatoum/Desktop/The neurosurgical core of knowledge"

# Run basic test
python3 test_gpt4o_basic.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úì Configuration correct!
# ‚úì GPT-4o text generation working!
# ‚úì All tests passed!
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Billing not set up" Error

**Symptoms:**
- New key still returns 401 error
- "Payment method required" message

**Solution:**
1. Billing MUST be active before creating key
2. Go to billing settings, add payment method
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for activation
4. Generate new key AFTER billing is active

### Issue 2: "You don't have access" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Can't access billing settings
- "Contact organization owner" message

**Solution:**
- You need to be organization owner/admin
- Contact your organization owner
- Or create a new OpenAI account (free)

### Issue 3: Key Still Not Working After Billing Setup

**Symptoms:**
- Billing active
- New key created
- Still getting 401 error

**Solution:**
1. Wait 5 minutes (propagation delay)
2. Check usage limits:
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage
   - Verify you haven't exceeded limits
3. Try creating key with different permissions:
   - "All" permission instead of restricted
4. Try creating key from different project

### Issue 4: Can't Find API Keys Page

**Direct Links:**
- Billing: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing
- API Keys: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Usage: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage
- Projects: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your API Key

1. **Never commit `.env` to git**
   - Already in `.gitignore` ‚úì
   - Double-check: `git status` should not show `.env`

2. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Create new key every 90 days
   - Delete old keys from OpenAI dashboard

3. **Set spending limits**
   - Recommended: $10/month soft limit
   - Hard limit: $50/month
   - Set at: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/limits

4. **Monitor usage**
   - Check daily: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage
   - Set up email alerts in billing settings

5. **Use project-based keys**
   - Scope keys to specific projects
   - Easier to revoke if compromised
